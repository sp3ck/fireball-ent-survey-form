# fireball-ent-survey-form
A survey form for an imaginary company called Fireball Entertainment

Also part of my second FCC's responsive web design project that is to build a survey page.

This survey page was built by only using HTML/CSS with no Javascript involved.

Although I would like to style the checkboxes and radios and animate the bg, its getting quite complicated as I should have built the core layout first. Oh well, keep this for now and move on to the next one.

maybe ill rebuild this in the future!

The live version of this page can be found here: https://sp3ck.github.io/fireball-ent-survey-form/

Passed all 17 tests.
